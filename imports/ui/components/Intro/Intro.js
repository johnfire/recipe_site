            <p>welcome to Christopher Rehm's recipe sharing site. this is a place where you can share your recipes and cooking ideas,
                 and have the measurements translated between english and metric without any problems. 
                 Later I'll add automatic translation for the recipes depending on your prefered language. 
                 This is a project to learn React, Meteor, MongoDB and several other web application tools. 
                 I hope you enjoy the site. </p>
